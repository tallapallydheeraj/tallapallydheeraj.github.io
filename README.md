## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer with a Master’s in Computer Science** and hands-on experience building **scalable, cloud-native systems** and **full-stack applications**. I specialize in designing reliable backend architectures, developing APIs, and integrating cloud services that scale in production environments.

I enjoy working close to the system layer — **APIs, databases, cloud workflows, and performance optimization** — while still caring deeply about clean interfaces and developer experience.

Currently, I work at **Cigna Health Group**, where I help modernize systems using **AWS serverless architecture, Golang, and infrastructure as code**.
