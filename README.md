## About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and professional
experience building **production-grade, cloud-native systems** in highly regulated
domains.

My work focuses on:
- Designing **reliable backend services**
- Orchestrating **distributed workflows**
- Ensuring **correctness, scalability, and observability**
- Translating complex business processes into clean, maintainable systems

I currently work at **Cigna (Evernorth / Accredo Specialty Pharmacy)**, where I help
modernize and automate critical healthcare workflows using **AWS serverless and
EKS, Golang, Java, Node.js, Terraform, and AI-assisted development**.

## How I Think as an Engineer

- **Correctness first** – systems must behave predictably under failure
- **Explicit workflows** – state machines over hidden control flow
- **Observability by default** – logs, metrics, and traces are non-negotiable
- **Scalability through decoupling** – event-driven and asynchronous designs
- **Trade-offs matter** – every design optimizes for something
