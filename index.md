## Software Engineer — Distributed & Cloud-Native Systems

I'm **Dheeraj Tallapally**, a Software Engineer based in Austin, TX, specializing in **cloud-native backend systems, distributed workflows, and AI-enabled platforms**.

At **Cigna (Evernorth / Accredo Specialty Pharmacy)**, I design and operate **AWS-based serverless systems** that orchestrate mission-critical healthcare workflows, including patient data processing, prescription scheduling, drug substitution logic, onboarding, and medication refills. My work focuses on **scalable APIs**, **event-driven architectures**, and **reliability** in production environments.

I'm particularly interested in building systems where **distributed design**, **observability**, and **intelligent automation** intersect to improve real-world outcomes.
