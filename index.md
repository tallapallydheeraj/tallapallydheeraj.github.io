## Software Engineer — Backend & Cloud Systems

I'm **Dheeraj Tallapally**, a Software Engineer based in Austin, TX, specializing in
**cloud-native backend systems and distributed workflows**.

I currently work at **Cigna (Evernorth / Accredo Specialty Pharmacy)**, building
and operating **AWS-based serverless systems** that orchestrate critical healthcare
operations such as **patient data and prescriptions**, **order scheduling for prescriptions**, **drug substitution** (complex clinical logic), onboarding, and medication refills.

I enjoy working on problems where **scale, correctness, and reliability** matter
as much as feature delivery.
