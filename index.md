## Software Engineer — Backend & Cloud Systems

I'm **Dheeraj Tallapally**, a Software Engineer based in Austin, TX, specializing in
**cloud-native backend systems, distributed workflows, and AI/ML** (from explainable healthcare AI to NLP and tooling).

I currently work at **Cigna (Evernorth / Accredo Specialty Pharmacy)**, building
and operating **AWS-based serverless systems** that orchestrate critical healthcare
operations such as **patient data and prescriptions**, **order scheduling for prescriptions**, **drug substitution** (complex clinical logic), onboarding, and medication refills. I use **AI-assisted tools** (e.g. Copilot, Cursor) to develop and review faster—I never depend on them; I always review and validate the output.

I enjoy working on problems where **scale, correctness, and reliability** matter
as much as feature delivery.

## What I Work On

- Distributed, event-driven backend systems
- AWS serverless and containerized workloads (Lambda, Step Functions, EKS)
- API design and orchestration (Golang, Java, Node.js, Python)
- Workflow automation in complex business domains
- Data modeling and performance optimization
- Data science and machine learning (sentiment analysis, NLP, RAG/LLMs)
