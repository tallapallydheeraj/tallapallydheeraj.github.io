## Software Engineer — Backend & Cloud Systems

I am a **Software Engineer based in Austin, TX**, specializing in
**cloud-native backend systems and distributed workflows**.

I currently work at **Cigna (Evernorth / Accredo Specialty Pharmacy)**, building
and operating **AWS-based serverless systems** that orchestrate critical healthcare
operations such as prescription processing, onboarding, prior authorization, and
medication refills.

I enjoy working on problems where **scale, correctness, and reliability** matter
as much as feature delivery.
